    "\n",
    "Abstract\n",
    "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory and gated recurrent units in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of reducing sequential computation also leads to the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU, ByteNet and ConvS2S, all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Background\n",
    "The goal of reducing sequential computation also motivated the creation of the Extended Neural GPU, ByteNet and ConvS2S, all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Architecture\n",
    "Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence to a sequence of continuous representations, which is then mapped to an output sequence by the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Why Self-Attention\n",
    "In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations to another sequence.\n",

    "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract\n",
    "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction\n",
    "Language model pre-training has been shown to be effective for improving many natural language processing tasks. These include sentence-level tasks such as natural language inference and paraphrasing, which aim to predict the relationships between sentences by analyzing them holistically.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language representations to downstream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The feature-based approach uses task-specific architectures that include the pre-trained representations as additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Related Work\n",
    "There has been a long history of pre-training general language representations, and we briefly review the most widely-used approaches in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\n",
    "Learning widely applicable representations of words has been an active area of research for decades, including non-neural and neural methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\n",
    "As with the feature-based approaches, the first works in this direction only pre-trained word embedding parameters from unlabeled text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. BERT\n",
    "We introduce BERT and its detailed implementation in this section. There are two steps in our framework: pre-training and fine-tuning.\n",
